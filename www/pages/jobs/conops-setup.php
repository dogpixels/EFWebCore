<p>A lot of stuff needs to be taken care of before the first guest even arrives at the hotel, and after everybody goes home a lot of stuff needs to broke down. The setup crew takes care of everything that needs to be done to make the convention great! Helping building up decorations, furniture, unloading of our trucks and much more. Your duty starts on the early early arrival day (Monday) until Wednesday morning and again from Sunday to Monday. You will be helping all over the convention and you can expect a heavy workload during this time, but you will be free during all normal convention days.</p>
<p>You need to be at the convention from Monday morning until Monday evening 7 days later. Be ready to move very heavy equipment! Safety boots and gloves are recommended!</p>
