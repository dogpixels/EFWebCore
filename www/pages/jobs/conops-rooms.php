<p>Room management takes care of all panels held in the conference rooms of the hotel. The diversity of events taking place makes it necessary to maintain a lot of different materials, ranging from projectors to PA-systems but also simpler things like office materials. Working hours of this department start daily before the first event and end after the last one. You can expect multiple short shifts of about 20-40 minutes every day between events.</p>
<p>Fluency in English is mandatory for this position, and you need to be reliable and are expected to be on time.</p>
