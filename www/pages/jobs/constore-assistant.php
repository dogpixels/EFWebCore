<p>The Convention Store in the Dealers’ Den is responsible for providing people with the current (and past) official t-shirts, as also for handing out the benefit package for sponsors and super sponsors.<br />This means we’re in contact with a lot of people from all over the world, so English is a must - but being creative when no common language works is also a big plus.</p>
<div>
<p>So, what would be your duties?
    <ul>
        <li>Selling t-shirts, or giving your colleagues on the register a hand by preparing/prepacking</li>
        <li>Point of contact for sponsors - handing out packages</li>
        <li>“Selling” old merchandise to collect money for charity</li>
    </ul>
</p>
</div>
<p>We’re operating during the regular Dealers’ Den opening times, as also during the setup and teardown times for dealers - from Thursday to Saturday. If you think you have some hours to spare in those opening times, please contact me at <a href="mailto:constore@eurofurence.org">constore@eurofurence.org</a> or on Telegram, <a href="https://t.me/vulniir" target="_blank">@Vulniir</a></p>
