<p>The Eurofurence stage team operates three live event stages at Europe's largest furry convention. The team of 30 volunteers provides infrastructure and services to events big and small, from solo artists to dance competitions and fully-fledged theater shows.</p>

<p>We want to deliver high-quality entertainment to our guests. To that end, our volunteers work colloratively with the artists from vision to concept to reality.</p>

<p>To bolster our leadership ranks, we are looking for an additional Stage Director.</p>

<p><strong>Your Responsibilities</strong></p>

<p>Eurofurence Directors (commonly called "red badges") are responsible for leading their team of volunteers. As one of four Stage Directors you are going to work shoulder to shoulder with three seasoned veterans of the Eurofurence trade. You will engage in association-wide communication with other directors across different crafts and trades; your engaging and pro-active communication style makes you the perfect contact person for our external and internal partners and together you work out the details of stage planning. You bear the responsibility of production management gracefully, juggling numbers and spreadsheets like it's your second nature.</p>

<p>The final scope of your position will depend on your skills and interests at the point of application.</p>
