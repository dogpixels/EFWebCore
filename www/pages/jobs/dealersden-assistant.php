<p>Our team specializes in creating a welcoming atmosphere for all artists, dealers and their helpers. We enable dealers to focus on what is most important to them: fulfilling even the most unique requests and wide ranging needs of their clients.</p>
<p>We are the ones 
    <ul>
        <li>planning, building and preparing the Dealers’ Den, AD Dealers’ Den and the Artist Alley,</li>
        <li>providing services to artists, dealers and their helpers and</li>
        <li>responding to their requests within the facilities serviced by us,</li>
        <li>keeping all our serviced areas in a tidy, presentable condition at all times,</li>
        <li>answering questions from our beloved attendees, artists and dealers about the Dealer's Den and all areas affiliated with us.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Being on our team is the perfect way to get immersed in the very heart of action at one of Eurofurence's high-traffic venues. As one of our on-site assistants, you are responsible for assisting the Dealers' Den and all affiliated areas. You have to be familiar with traditional tools such as paper lists as well as digital media, including how to utilize them. You will be trained by us on which products we allow to be displayed on the stands for sale.
    <ul>
        <li>You are sufficiently fluent in English to communicate within our team, the dealers and our attendees. Fluency in German and/or other languages would be a plus.</li>
        <li>You already have knowledge in the field of sales, guest services or have other experience in interacting with customers in a professional manner on site or would like to learn more about this topic.</li>
        <li>You have a sense of how to handle even challenging situations in a calm, de-escalating manner, and always with a smile. In stressful situations, you remain quiet, collected, and professional.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>You may have to spend a few extra hours during the convention, as we need to fill all of our time slots with responsible people. We also need someone to help with setup on Wednesday and teardown on Sunday morning and would love to have you join us. It would be a great advantage - but not a requirement - if you booked early arrival (Tuesday) and late departure (Monday).</p>
<p>Following your application, we will have a brief call with you to get to know you a little bit. A personal conversation between you and the team leader will help all sides to make sure we are on the same page with any questions you may have.</p>
