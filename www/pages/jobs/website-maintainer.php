    All the web applications surrounding Eurofurence are built within our community, by volunteer furries. The website team, as one of a few departments working all around the year on digital applications of Eurofurence, has built everything you see on
    <ul>
        <li>www.eurofurence.org</li>
        <li>help.eurofurence.org</li>
        <li>archive.eurofurence.org</li>
    </ul>
    and some other places other than subdomains of eurofurence.org.
</p>

<p>
    Behind those websites, applications and tools are the people maintaining them. And that's where you come in.<br />
    You will be given the responsibility of one such part and directly influence its development.<br />
    Our welcoming team will be at your side with help and advice, but you will also be able to make decisions on your own.
</p>

<p>
    This position is explicitly viable for beginners. If you want to get a foot into web development, this might be your chance. The project is not urgent and allows to settle into your new position with ease.<br />
    However, some basic understanding of HTML, CSS, JS and PHP would be advisable.
