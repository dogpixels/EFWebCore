<p>Our team specializes in creating an animated short movie for all our attendees to enjoy during the Opening Show. It’s embedded in a mixed media show that also includes live action stage elements, music and much more.</p>
<p>Being in our team is the perfect way to get immersed in the theme of this year’s Eurofurence. As our Blender camera specialist, you are responsible to make the most of our scenes and characters and show them in the best way possible according to our script. You are going to join our team of animators, modelers, particle effects specialists and much more.</p>
<ul>
    <li>You are sufficiently fluent in English to communicate within our team. Fluency in German and/or other languages would be a plus.</li>
    <li>You have good knowledge about Blender. You are very good with setting up cameras and how to use them.</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t have to work on-site during the convention as all your work is done before the convention starts. You can join our rehearsal on Wednesday of course! </p>
<p>Following your application, we will have a brief call with you to get to know you a little bit. A personal conversation between you and the team leader will help all sides to make sure we are on the same page with any questions you may have.</p>
<p>Are you interested in joining the Opening Show team and becoming our new Camera Specialist? Please contact <a href="https://t.me/pattarchus" target="_blank">@Pattarchus on Telegram</a> and he will get back to you shortly. Thank you for taking the time to read this. The Eurofurence team looks forward to hearing from you!</p>
