<p>Our team is responsible for engaging local restaurants, intriguing points of interest and other vendors for both small and larger goodies to benefit our attendees.</p>
<p>We are the ones 
    <ul>
        <li>talking to potential partners in preparation for the convention, recruiting them for the Show-Your-Badge and showcasing them to attendees.</li>
        <li>answering the questions of our Show-Your-Badge partners, as well as our attendees about the affiliate program.</li>
        <li>visiting our partners during and after the convention, to check if everything went smoothly.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Joining our team is your opportunity to get involved in the many ways we organize Eurofurence and finish all the work in time until the beginning of the convention. Simultaneously you make sure our attendees will be able to get the most out of their stay in Berlin. As our Local Scout you are the one responsible for the acquisition and support of our local partners. You will mainly use digital media and also maintain our database for the app. You will be trained in all aspects around your job and have constant support from your Team Lead and another Scout Consultant.</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>You are fluent in German and have good written (email, chat) and verbal (personally, phone) communication skills in German as well. You are sufficiently fluent in English to answer questions from our attendees and our Social Media department. Fluency in other languages would be a plus.</li>
        <li>You already have knowledge in the field of sales, guest services or have other experience in interacting with people in a professional manner or would like to learn more about this topic.</li>
        <li>You have a good understanding of Google Office (Docs, Sheets) and related tools.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>To become part of the team, the minimum requirement is that you live in Berlin or within reach of the public transport system. You will meet and talk personally with the future partners in Berlin. Therefore, a certain willingness to travel as well as an outgoing nature are absolutely essential. You will be trained in all aspects of the job by your Team Lead (Director) and will be given lots of useful information, suggestions and support. If you really enjoy talking to people and have a positive, friendly personality, this job is for you.</p>
<p>Following your application, we will have a brief call in German with you to get to know you a little bit. A personal conversation between you and the team leader will help all sides to make sure we are on the same page with any questions you may have.</p>
