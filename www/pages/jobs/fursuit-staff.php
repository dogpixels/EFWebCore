<p>The fursuit support team is the friendly crew in the background, who keeps the growing number of fursuiters alive at Eurofurence each year. We’re the ones</p>
<ul>
    <li>running the fursuit lounge</li>
    <li>providing dances and panels with blowers and refreshments</li>
    <li>planning fursuit excursions and the parade</li>
    <li>providing service and help with any fursuit related issue</li>
</ul>
<p>Being part of the fursuit team is one of the best ways to make sure you get to meet all those fluffballs first hand. Currently the team consists of about 25 volunteers.</p>
<p>The main driving force of the team, and a genuine staff position. You have attended EF a few times and know your way around? Maybe you even worked for the convention before and want to keep being awesome to others in general and fursuiters especially? Much like the helper, your job is to keep the lounge running and equipped, keep an open eye for any medical or social emergencies in the lounge, and assist with fursuit events if needed. You will also be running your timeslot shift as “person in charge” either alone or with a helper.</p>
<p>You can also specialise on a certain aspect of duties. Purchase preparations, resource management, construction,..</p>
<p>You may have to dedicate a few more hours during the convention, as we need to fill all timeslots with responsible people. We also need people to help with setup and breakdown on early-day and on dead-dog day, and would love to see you there if any possible.</p>
