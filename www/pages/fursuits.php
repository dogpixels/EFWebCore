<h1>Fursuit Support</h1>
<section class="uk-column-1-2@l">
	<p>With over 40% of all attendees being fursuiters, Eurofurence ranks among the major furry conventions with the highest costumer quotas. It is incredibly nice to see so many furry critters around all the time and we would like to thank you all for returning again and making everyones experience so special.</p>
	<p>To help you finding your way around the convention, following you can find some information and useful tips for fursuiters at Eurofurence.</p>

	<h2>Fursuit Badges</h2>
	<p>Eurofurence offers every registered fursuiter one free personal fursuit badge. Bringing more than one fursuit? No problem! You can get a badge for each of them for just 2 € per additional badge. These badges are a fantastic way to show off your fursuit and make it easier for others to recognize you.</p>
	<p>Plus, you can join in on the fun with our Catch-Em-All Game! Meet fellow fursuiters, exchange badge codes, and see how many you can collect. The top collector will be celebrated at the closing ceremony and earn a spot on our eternal leaderboard.</p>
	<p>How to Get Your Badge:
		<ul>
			<li>First Preoder Badge Free: Simply register for Eurofurence and get your first fursuit badge for free.</li>
			<li>Additional Badges & Late Orders: Order more for just 2 € each.</li>
			<li>On-Site Services: Need a last-minute badge? We’ve got you covered with our late printing service for a small fee.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Stay tuned for a registration opening time to be announced here.</p>
	<!-- <p>The registration for the Fursuit Badges will open on 22nd July 2024 at <a href="https://fursuit.eurofurence.org" target="_blank">fursuit.eurofurence.org</a></p> -->

	<h2>Fursuit Lounge</h2>
	<p>All fursuiters have access to the Fursuit Lounge. This is a fursuiters-only area where you can change into your costume, go headless, relax and have access to cold water and some sweet and salty snacks to keep your blood sugar and mineral supply at a healthy level.</p>
	<p>The Fursuit Lounge is also home of the pipe monster, aka the fursuit drying rack. Aside several normal racks to hang your fursuit, we provide about 60 spaces connected to a turbo fan powered drying system, to get your suit, head and paws dry again in no time.</p>
	<p>However, with about 1000 suiters around, we highly encourage to check on your drying costume regularly and remove it from the dryer as soon as possible, to make room for someone elses costume. Thank you in advance.</p>
	<p>To respect the privacy and comfort of attending fursuiters, access is limited to costumers only. Photography and videotaping are prohibited in the lounge.	The lounge is open from the convention opening ceremonies to Sunday noon. It will be locked during the night.</p>

	<h3>Fursuiters with no room at the Hotel</h3>
	<p>Our &#8216;no-room&#8217;-guests are welcome to leave their costumes in the lounge, if they wish to.
	If you do so, it is at your own risk. Eurofurence e.V. is not liable for anything left in the lounge.
	In the past, we noticed that a lot of no-room suiters left their suits on the dryer from the evening after their last use, until next day (after)noon, when they came in after panels or alike. DO NOT DO THIS. Please bring your suit to the security depot or at least remove all your parts from the dryer before you leave for the night, and put them on a normal rack.</p>
	
	<h3>Fursuit Photoshoot &amp; Group Photo</h3>
	<p>The details for these events are not yet final. We will update this as soon as the info is available.</p>

	<h3>Fursuit Panel Support</h3>
	<p>If you are hosting a public fursuit event, a show or panel, we can also support you with a few fans and water dispensers. Just inform the programming guys about this when submitting your panel, and check back with us, once your spot is confirmed. (And no, sorry, we do not offer this service for private room parties, as even our resources are limited. ;-) )</p>
