<h1>Accessibility</h1>

<p>People have the right to participate in public life and society, and no one should be disadvantaged because of their disability. Here we provide information on what we are doing to make our convention more accessible and provide a better experience.</p>

		<h2>Queuing</h2>
		<p>If you can not walk / stand, you do not have to queue up and wait in a line.</p>
		<p>If you have a "Handicapped ID" (Behindertenausweis) or you are (without handicapped ID) disabled in regard of <strong>walking or standing</strong> (i.e. after an operation or because of an injury such as a broken foot/leg) or in <strong>need of a wheelchair</strong> you are <strong>not</strong> required to queue yourself at all for our events. The Queue Management Security Group will let you enter directly into the respective event at the command doors open.</p>
		<p>Example for Handicapped ID: German "Behindertenausweis" with signs außergewöhnlich gehbehindert ("<strong>aG</strong>"), blind ("<strong>Bl</strong>") or hilflos ("<strong>H</strong>")</p>

Only valid certifications will be accepted.</p>
		<p>Certifications for <strong>Assistant dogs</strong> can be verified OnSite in the Security Office at any time according to the AHundV. A verification is only valid for one convention and has to be renewed every year (in the same way).</p>

		<h2>Website</h2>
		<p>Eurofurence endeavors to make its websites accessible.</p>
		<p>This website is predominantly accessible. The requirements of WCAG 2.2 AA are largely met from a technical point of view.</p>
		<p>
			Still, we have some points, that are not accessible or hardly accessible. We are endeavoring to eliminate the remaining barriers.
			<ul>
				<li>Modals are not accessible via keyboard navigation only.</li>
				<li>Menu does not expand while using keyboard navigation only.</li>
				<li>The graphics for the nose count are not accessible for some people with disabilities.</li>
			</ul>
